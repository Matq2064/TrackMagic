Maybe you're asking questions like.. wtf is pip and why are you screaming PATH. \
Bro, just don't question it.
### How to pip if has no pip
1. Install python if not already installed. \
 1.1 If you don't have python and you're installing, then enable the option `Add to %PATH%` and you will get the pip.
2. Now if you already had python and pip is missing, head over to windows search and type `Edit the system enviroment variables`.
3. Click the first result that shows up and in the next window select `Enviroment Variables...`.
4. Another window should appear, now just click `Path` or `PATH` in the `User variables for X` section.
5. Select the option `Edit` and ANOTHER window should appear.
6. Now select `New` and we will have to add the path to the directory that contains `pip.exe`. \
 6.1 Head over to `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python`. \
 6.2 Find the python version that you just installed and enter the `Scripts` folder.
 6.3 Copy the path to this directory, should look something like `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonYOURVERSION\Scripts`
7. Now you should have pip added, you can exit all the windows by clicking `Ok`.
